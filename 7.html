Clearly my immune system has taken a battering, what with the food poisoning while away, then a cold has turned into a chest infection. So I'm proper poorly though recovering now! Chest infection wasn't too severe but as I have reduced lung function due to a scoliosis and asthma, even a cold is a threat. My breathing is a lot better now the medication has kicked in, just need to find some energy! But, I'm taking it as my body's way of saying REST so I'm trying to! Anyway here are a few photos taken during July to keep you entertained! Above is a sunset shot of Sandside Bay, Hoy High ligthhouse, and Sandside (my hoose!).<br/> <br/> This was taken from up the West end of Graemsay looking towards Stromness with the MV Graemsay ferry setting off for Hoy.<br/> <br/> <br/> And the black specs are coos (cattle) up on the hill at Western Horn.<br/> <br/> <br/> And though we've had a pretty settled summer, we've had our share of cloud and mist.... but the island retains her beauty whatever the weather :-)<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <span> Posted by <span> <span> Sian</span> </span> </span> <span> at 14:10 </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> <span> </span> </span> <span> Email This</span> <span> BlogThis!</span> <span> Share to Twitter</span> <span> Share to Facebook</span> <span> Share to Pinterest</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <h4> 5 comments:</h4> Bonnie <span> </span> <span> 24 July 2016 at 20:45 </span> <p> You are having a rough time getting better. Sometimes you just have to stop and listen to your body, and if it says rest then that s exactly what you have to do. It s hard, but necessary.
