Book Provides Action Plan To Stop Pension Looting</h1> <span> Edward Siedle <span> Contributor</span> <span> Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. </span> </span> Retirement <span> Share to Facebook</span> <span> Share to Twitter</span> <span> Share to Linkedin</span> <p> Cheddar New Channel </p> Mona Gambetta <p> “Who Stole My Pension? How You Can Stop the Looting” provides an action plan for pension stakeholders, including taxpayers, workers and retirees seeking to enhance pension protection. Insights gleaned over decades from $1 trillion-plus in forensic investigations of pensions on behalf of regulators and law enforcement can be used to combat Wall Street looting of pensioners worldwide. </p> <p> When Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling personal finance author of all-time and I discussed writing a book about the pension crisis last year, we agreed our goal was to provide new insights into the looming retirement crisis; the primary cause of pension failures; and a plan of action for the future. The book had to be based upon sophisticated, expert forensic insights yet easy-to-read. Neither of us wanted to write another intimidating pension book that no one understood. </p> <p> · <strong> The Looming Global Retirement Crisis</strong> </p> <p> The author of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series and I open by stating the obvious: </p> <p> We are in the early stages of the greatest retirement crisis in the history of our nation and indeed the entire world. In the decades to come, we will witness hundreds of millions of elders globally, including the Baby Boomers in America, slipping into poverty.</p> <p> Too frail to work, too poor to retire will become the “new normal” for many of our oldest.</p> <p> The good news is that more people—globally—are living longer than ever.</p> MORE FOR YOU <h3> The Case Of The Evil Caregiver And How She Was Stopped</h3> <h3> Most Popular Offers For Veterans Day 2020</h3> <h3> Why Did Illinois Voters Reject The So-Called ‘Fair Tax’ Amendment? And What’s Next?</h3> <p> According to the World Health Organization, nearly two billion people across the world are expected to be over 60 years old by 2050, a figure that’s more than triple what it was in 2000.</p> <p> For better or for worse, there simply have never been more elderly people living on planet Earth.</p> <p> The bad news is that only a very small minority of these folks have enough personal savings to pay for—to survive—decades of retirement.</p> <p> Worse still, those who are counting upon the few remaining corporate pensions for their retirement security can be sure the company sponsoring the plan—their past or present employer—is consulting with experts, plotting how to screw workers out of the benefits they mistakenly think they have been “promised” and save the corporation money. </p> <p> Any so-called “promises” an employer may have made are, at best shaky, or even illusory—worthless. </p> <p> State and local government pensions in the United States hold almost $4 trillion in assets and provide retirement benefits for roughly 21 million current and former state and local employees. These are teachers, firefighters, and police officers who serve their communities. However, more than half of these governments have reduced those benefits since the 2008 recession.</p> <p> Workers in government pensions around the world can count on politicians and taxpayers running to legislatures and courts to cut benefits workers have been “promised” when these already struggling government pensions start to run out of money. </p> <p> So much for so-called “retirement security.”</p> <p> · <strong> Mismanagement of Investments—“gross malpractice generally practiced”—is the primary reason pensions fail </strong> </p> <p> To fix or protect pensions, it is critical to understand how they work and why pensions fail.</p> <p> Fortunately, the fundamentals of pensions are easy to understand.</p> <p> There are three components to the health of a pension:</p> <p> 1. Money In: How much money goes into the pension “pot” (contributions);</p> <p> 2. Money Invested: How the money in the pot is managed or invested over, say, a worker’s 30-years of employment; and</p> <p> 3. Money Out: How much money is paid out of the pot (benefits).</p> <p> If any one of the above three drivers of pension health is amiss, then the pension may falter or fail. </p> <p> Likewise, simply put, there are three ways to fix a failing pension.</p> <p> 1. Put more money in the pot;</p> <p> 2. Invest the money in the pot better; or</p> <p> 3. Pay less out of the pot.</p> <p> That leads to the primary focus of the book— the least understood, least discussed cause of, and fix to, the pension crisis: mismanagement of the investments. </p> <p> In every forensic investigation of a dead or dying pension I’ve undertaken—over $1 trillion—I have concluded: </p> <p> Had the money in the pot been prudently managed, the pension would not have failed. </p> <p> That is, enough money had been put into the pot to pay out all the benefits promised—had the money been managed properly. </p> <p> Likewise, in every case I’ve witnessed where a so-called pension “fix” or “reform” has been undertaken, mismanagement of the investments was neglected and, not surprising, the “fix” flopped. That is, within a few years the pension was no better off than pre-fix. </p> <p> Management of pension investments globally today can most aptly be described as “gross malpractice generally practiced,” in my expert opinion. </p> <p> Other disturbing “pension realities” discussed in support of the contention pension stakeholders need to take immediate action to stop the looting include: </p> <p> · The people watching over pensions (boards of directors/trustees) almost universally lack investment experience; </p> <p> · Pensions are becoming increasingly less transparent at the behest of Wall Street; </p> <p> · Pensions are gambling on high-cost, high-risk investments more than ever; </p> <p> · Pensions routinely lie about the investment fees they pay, their investment performance and funding levels. </p> <p> · Pensions, particularly those for state and local government workers, are not adequately protected under law or by law enforcement;</p> <p> · Many pensions are not fully audited by independent accounting firms. </p> <p> Our message to workers and pensioners is loud and clear: </p> <p> Now is the time for immediate action to stop the looting and protect pensions by ensuring promises made are, in fact, kept. </p> <p> If you’re worried about your pension, consider sponsoring an internet crowdfunded forensic investigation by an expert of your choosing, instead of relying upon the conflicted advisers retained by your pension. You need a second opinion. </p> <p> Doing nothing—sitting back, confident your pension check is “in the mail” is not an option. That’s a risk you can’t afford to take. </p> <span> Check out </span> my website .
