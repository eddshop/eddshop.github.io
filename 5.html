Well helloooo February <span> </span> <h2> Who stole my energy? </h2> <span> Posted on</span> <span> January 11, 2017</span> <span> <span> by</span> <span> kirstinchaplin </span> </span> <p> I&#8217;ll be honest. I thought that, by now, almost two weeks into this no drinking malarky I would be feeling well, better than I do.</p> <p> This morning, when the alarm went off at 6.15am (yes, that is early isn&#8217;t it? And to think I was contemplating getting up even earlier to do some yoga! Pah) I felt as though I had been hit with a sledge hammer.</p> <p> I&#8217;ve also deduced that alcohol might not be the only cause of my crazy mood swings because they are 100% still happening. Yesterday I swung from irrationally happy that I have a tumble dryer and that it dried our clothes (I mean ) to total overwhelm about cooking / fashion / work / interior design. This stuff seems so easy to everyone else but, every day, it threatens to swollow me up.</p> <p> Anyway, I digress. My sugar consumption has also gone through the ROOF. I literally can&#8217;t shove enough of the stuff into my face and, again, it feels too overwhelming to tackle this as well as give up booze / cope with life / put makeup on in the mornings!</p> <p> Perhaps this crazy phase of adjustment will pass soon. I hope so.</p> <p> Meanwhile, all around me, people are falling off the Dry January wagon faster than you can say &#8216;herbal tea&#8217; which makes me a teeny bit envious that they will soon be locking lips with a delicious fruity red.</p> <p> OK, enough rambling for one day. Time to push on with the day.</p> <p> K x</p> <p> P.S. My Saturday headache turned into a full-blown migraine so, in the interests of fairness, I doubt very much it was caused by the Becks Blue.</p> <p> </p> <h3> Share this:</h3> <span> Twitter</span> <span> Facebook</span> <h3> Like this:</h3> <span> <span> Like</span> </span> <span> Loading...</span> <span> </span> This entry was posted in Uncategorized .
